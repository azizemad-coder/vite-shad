Instructions:
* Maintain a clean, well-organized project structure.
* Write clean, well-structured, and readable code — messy code stresses me out.
* Avoid hardcoding anything — always use configs or environment variables.
* Follow industry best practices at all times.
* Use **PNPM** as the package manager.
* The codebase must be in **TypeScript**, with `"type": "module"` set in `package.json`.
* Always aim to solve tasks using the fewest lines of code without sacrificing clarity.
* Optimize the app for production. Use checks like `isProd = process.env.APP_ENV === "production"` and apply all relevant production optimizations.
* Optimize the app for production. Use checks like `isProd = APP_ENV === "production"` and apply all relevant production optimizations.

For UI:         
* Build a modern UI using Tailwind and shadcn/ui. Dark theme. Minimal layout. Big typography. Smooth corners. Shadowed cards. Think Raycast or Linear, not Bootstrap.

Shell: I'm using Powershell so avoid syntax errors like instead of using && use ; or curl -> invoke webRequest
